How to prepare your environment to get this project working

- run database/createDB.sql tu create project database
- connect to new created db and run database/ddl.sql and databasse/fill_db/sql
    - be aware that fill_db.sql is dummy insert that rely on id's that will be given in the empty database.
      It will not work when you tried to run it again even after one failed run.
      If something will failed during the run i recommend to drop whole database and start the creation from the begging

- copy jbossSetup/postgresql-42.1.4.jar and jbossSetup/modele.xml into your %JBOSS_HOME%\modules\system\layers\base\org\postgresql\main\
  You may need to create those directories

- now you need to specify a datasource in jboss that will be used by our application
- open %JBOSS_HOME\standalone\confiiguration\standalone.xml and find part with datasources. You will see there a configuration for ExampleDS
- add a definition for your datasource
        <datasource jta="true" jndi-name="java:/SmartRestaurant" pool-name="SmartRestaurant" enabled="true" use-java-context="true" use-ccm="true">
            <connection-url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/smart_restaurant</connection-url>
            <driver>org.postgresql</driver>
            <pool>
                <min-pool-size>1</min-pool-size>
                <max-pool-size>4</max-pool-size>
                <prefill>false</prefill>
                <use-strict-min>false</use-strict-min>
                <flush-strategy>FailingConnectionOnly</flush-strategy>
            </pool>
            <security>
                <user-name>restaurant_app_user</user-name>
                <password>DoIt4Tweety</password>
            </security>
            <validation>
                <check-valid-connection-sql>SELECT 1</check-valid-connection-sql>
                <validate-on-match>false</validate-on-match>
                <background-validation>false</background-validation>
                <use-fast-fail>false</use-fast-fail>
            </validation>
        </datasource>

- right under that you will see configuration of drivers, also add our driver
    <driver name="org.postgresql" module="org.postgresql"/>

- try to deploy the application
- if you will get Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.dom4j.DocumentFactory cannot be cast to org.dom4j.DocumentFactory
  during deployment of the application, you need to go to project settings in IDEA and remove dom4j from the libraries.
  I have no ida how it appears there, but it seem that it is different version than in JBOSS configuration and for that you're
  getting the ClassCastException.

- if you were successuful you should see:
    - landing page at http://localhost:8080/SmartRestaurant/
    - should be able to call API at http://localhost:8080/SmartRestaurant/api/v1/hello
